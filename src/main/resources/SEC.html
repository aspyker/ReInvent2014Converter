			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">The cloud requires us to rethink much of what we do to secure our applications. The idea of physical security morphs as infrastructure becomes virtualized by AWS APIs. In a new world of ephemeral, autoscaling infrastructure, you need to adapt your security architecture to meet both compliance and security threats. And AWS provides powerful tools that enable users to confidently overcome these challenges.

In this&nbsp;session,&nbsp;we will discuss leveraging native AWS tools as we cover topics including:


	Minimizing attack vectors and surface area.
	Conducting perimeter assessments of your virtual private clouds (VPCs).
	Identifying internal vs. external threats.
	Monitoring threats.
	Reevaluating intrusion detection, activity monitoring, and vulnerability assessment in AWS.

					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">This session brings together the interests of engineering, compliance, and security as you align healthcare workloads to the controls in the HIPAA Security Rule. We'll discuss how to architect for HIPAA compliance using AWS, and introduce a number of new services added to the HIPAA program in 2015, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR). You'll hear from customers who process and store Protected Health Information on AWS, and how they satisfied their compliance requirements while maintaining agility.

This session helps security and compliance experts see what's technically possible on AWS, and how implementing the Technical Safeguards in the HIPAA Security Rule is simple and familiar. We map the Security Rule's Technical Safeguards to AWS features and design patterns to help developers, operations teams, and engineers speak the language of their security and compliance peers. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

With Config Rules, you can continuously evaluate whether changes to resources are compliant with policies. You can set up predefined rules, provided and managed by AWS, or author your own rules using Amazon Lambda, and these rules are evaluated whenever relevant resources are modified. You can use this visibility and control to assess and improve your security and compliance posture.

We will dive deep into other new capabilities in AWS Config and cover how you can integrate with IT service management, configuration management, and other tools. In this session, we will look at:


	AWS Config Rules – how to create and use rules that govern configuration changes recorded by AWS Config.
	New capabilities in AWS Config – Usability changes, better controls and other enhancements
	Mechanisms to aggregate deep visibility across AWS to gain insights into your overall security and operational posture.

					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Ever wondered how can you find out which user made a particular API call, when the call&nbsp;was made, and which resources were acted upon? In this session, you will learn how to turn on AWS CloudTrail for hundreds of AWS accounts in all AWS regions to ensure you have full visibility into API activity in all your AWS accounts. We will demonstrate how to use CloudTrail Lookup in the AWS Management Console to troubleshoot operational and security issues and how to use the AWS CLI or SDKs to integrate your applications with CloudTrail.

We will also demonstrate how you can monitor for specific API activity by using Amazon CloudWatch and receive email notifications, when such activity occurs. Using CloudTrail Lookup and CloudWatch Alarms, you can take immediate action to quickly remediate any security or operational issues. We will also share best practices and&nbsp;ready-to-use scripts, and dive deep into new features that help you configure additional layers of security for CloudTrail log files. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

				<span class="title">AWS Security Beyond the Host: Leveraging the Power of AWS to Automate Security and Compliance</span>
			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">You’ve made the move to AWS and are now reaping the benefits of&nbsp;decreased costs and increased business agility. How can you reap those same benefits for your cloud security and compliance operations? As building cloud-native applications&nbsp;requires different skill sets, architectures, integrations, and processes, implementing effective, scalable, and robust security for the cloud requires rethinking everything from your security tools to your team culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Attend this session to learn how to start down the path toward security and compliance automation and hear how DevSecOps leaders such as Intuit and Capital One are using AWS, DevOps, and automation to transform their security operations.

			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">As an online payments provider, Stripe has always had a close relationship with PCI DSS. And as a partner to hundreds of thousands of online businesses, we take the security of our users' personal information very seriously. But as a fast-growing startup company where fast innovation is a key advantage, we also can't let PCI control us. In this session, we will discuss strategies we have used that both make us more secure and satisfy our PCI (and other) obligations, all without slowing down our ability to innovate. Though useful for PCI and other compliance obligations, these strategies can just as easily be applied to security problems across your organization. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">AWS provides all sorts of security features and capabilities, and these features generate tons of data to be sifted and analyzed. In this session, hear what we are doing to support ingestion, processing, and storage of data at scale to support our Security Science and DevSecOps programs. We've had a lot of experience understanding what is and is not possible for crunching security data using big data environments. In fact, we've discovered it's much easier to develop the tools and processes necessary to support applications than you might think. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">One of the biggest challenges in writing code that manages encrypted data is developing a secure model for obtaining keys and rotating them when an administrator leaves. AWS Key Management Service (KMS) changes the equation by offering key management as a service, enabling a number of security improvements over conventional key storage methods. Jon Todd will show how Okta uses the KMS&nbsp;API to secure a multi-region system serving thousands of customers.

				<span class="title">Enterprise Cloud Security via DevSecOps 2.0</span>
			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Running enterprise workloads with sensitive data in AWS is hard and requires an in-depth understanding about software-defined security risks. At re:Invent 2014, Intuit and AWS presented "Enterprise Cloud Security via DevSecOps" to help the community understand how to embrace AWS features and a software-defined security model. Since then, we've learned quite a bit more about running sensitive workloads in AWS.

We've evaluated new security features, worked with vendors, and generally explored how to develop security-as-code skills. Come join Intuit and AWS to learn about second-year lessons and see how DevSecOps is evolving. We've built skills in security engineering, compliance operations, security science, and security operations to secure AWS-hosted applications. We will share stories and insights about DevSecOps experiments, and show you how to crawl, walk, and then run into the world of DevSecOps. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Do you want to analyze AWS CloudTrail events within minutes of them arriving in your Amazon S3 bucket? Would you like to learn how to run expressive queries over your CloudTrail logs? We will demonstrate Apache Spark and Apache Spark Streaming as two tools to analyze recent and historical security logs for your accounts. To do so, we will use Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR), your logs stored in S3, and Amazon SNS to generate alerts. With these tools at your fingertips, you will be the first to know about security events that require your attention, and you will be able to quickly identify and evaluate the relevant security log entries. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>
