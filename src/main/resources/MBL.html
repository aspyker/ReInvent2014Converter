Examples of these skills include the ability to play music, answer general questions, set an alarm or timer and more. We will also be taking a quick look at how the healthcare industry is integrating with the Alexa Skills Kit for new use cases. With the Alexa Skills Kit, you can easily build and add your own skills to Alexa. Customers can then access these new skills simply by asking Alexa a question or making a command. This workshop will be a walkthrough of the latest Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) and will teach you how to build your own skills for Alexa enabled devices, like the Amazon Echo. You will get hands on experience with an Amazon Echo device, the Alexa Skills Kit and AWS Lambda. You will also learn how to monitor your new skill using AWS CloudWatch and how to test your skill using both the Alexa Service Simulator, AWS Lambda Unit Tests and an Amazon Echo device&nbsp;

Prerequisites:


	Experience with Node JS, JavaScript, and AWS Lambda is a plus but not required.
	Participants should have an AWS account established and available for use during the workshop.&nbsp;

				<span class="title">Scaling Native Cross-Platform Mobile Apps with C#, Xamarin, and AWS</span>
			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Xamarin enables C# developers to become native iOS, Android, and Windows mobile app developers overnight. Every great front-end mobile client needs a great backend service to power it, and that backend is AWS. The AWS Xamarin Mobile Services SDK enables these mobile apps to be instantly connected to AWS and take advantage of all the features you love such including Cloud Storage, AWS Lambda, Cloud NoSQL Database, and more. In addition to allowing you write your iOS and Android apps in C#, Xamarin lets you reuse existing .NET libraries and share your business logic across iOS, Android, and Windows apps. This means with Xamarin and AWS Xamarin Mobile SDK you have one C# shared backend to build and maintain, drastically cutting down development costs and increasing time to market.&nbsp; In this session, attendees will create iOS and Android mobile apps in Visual Studio with Xamarin and integrate them with the new AWS Mobile SDK for Xamarin.
