			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">The average game developer only monetizes 2-3% of their customers. What if you could monetize 100% of them? We’ll talk with Bryan Mashinter from Backflip Studios about three new ways to do this. In this session you’ll learn about: Amazon Underground where customers get premium apps and in-app items for free and developers get paid for all of the minutes used, Merch by Amazon a self-service on-demand t-shirt printing service that costs you nothing out of pocket, and Amazon Coins to help deepen engagement and improve your ARPU (average revenue per user) <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

				<span class="title">HTML5 vs Unity for Responsive Game Design</span>
			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Game developers have lots of options when it comes to picking platforms and frameworks for building their games. If you are looking to build true cross-platform games, there are two great options: HTML5 and Unity. But knowing which one to start with can be difficult. This talk discusses the pros and cons of each platform by looking at the same game built in Phaser (http://phaser.io) and Unity. We also discuss publishing options for both platforms and how to create truly cross-platform games from a single codebase. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Glu uses Amazon Kinesis, Apache Storm, S3, and Hadoop to collect billions of data points from millions of user devices in real-time every single day. This session describes how Glu built and configured an array of&nbsp;producers to submit real-time gaming events into Amazon Kinesis, using&nbsp;temporary tokens from Amazon Cognito,&nbsp;removing the need for an intermediate store-forward fleet. We then discuss how we've been able to easily integrate Amazon Kinesis with powerful open-source technologies such as Apache Storm and the Hadoop ecosystem. Finally, we discuss KCL optimizations and tradeoffs to manage a scalable, flexible, mission-critical streaming data platform.
