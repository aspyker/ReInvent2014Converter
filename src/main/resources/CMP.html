				<span class="title">All You Need To Know About Auto Scaling</span>
			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Adapting the capacity of your compute infrastructure to the demands of your applications is the domain of Auto Scaling. Adding and removing Amazon EC2 instances is only part of the story, though – there is more to it than first meets the eye. This session introduces the basics of how to use Auto Scaling before moving on to more advanced topics such as mixing Spot and On-Demand instances to optimize cost or strategies for blue/green deployments. If you have used Auto Scaling before, you can learn about useful new features like lifecycle hooks and step scaling policies that make Auto Scaling even more widely applicable. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Building great products, ones that are aesthetically appealing as well as functionally sound, requires cutting-edge design and engineering. Given the high cost of physical testing prototypes, engineering organizations are turning to simulation and analysis using digital models, but compute requirements for these have traditionally required expensive on-premises infrastructure. But now, engineering organizations can use high-performance computing services from AWS and solutions from AWS technology partners to innovate at scale globally, with no up-front capital infrastructure investment.

In this session, AWS Partner Ansys shares how they help customers of all sizes design and engineer better products through digital simulation and analysis using HPC on AWS. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">In recent years, containers have become a key component of modern application design. Increasingly, developers are breaking their applications apart into smaller components and distributing them across a pool of compute resources. It is relatively easy to run a few containers on your laptop, but building and maintaining an entire infrastructure to run and manage distributed applications is hard and requires a lot of undifferentiated heavy lifting.

In this session, we discuss some of the core architectural principles underlying Amazon ECS, a highly scalable, high performance service to run and manage distributed applications using the Docker container engine. We walk through a number of patterns used by our customers to run their microservices platforms, to run batch jobs, and for deployments and continuous integration. &nbsp;We explore the advanced scheduling capabilities of Amazon ECS and dive deep into the Amazon ECS Service Scheduler, which optimizes for long-running applications by monitoring container health, restarting failed containers, and load balancing across containers. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Each year, the technical complexity of making the next great Walt Disney Animation Studios film increases. Animation and Visual FX studios continue to push the bounds of what is possible in computer graphics. This complexity drives rapid technological growth in both computational resources and storage to the point that it exceeds what we can physically provide with our on-premise compute cluster. As a result, we have started to adopt a hybrid approach with the cloud.

This session addresses the hurdles that animation and VFX studios face and focuses on automation of 'disposable' components (specifically infrastructure, licensing, fleet management, data and dependency management in a large-scale batch workload). We apply these general cloud techniques and utilities to an animation/VFX workload and push the limits with a very large scale cloud renderfarm deployment.

The team from Walt Disney Animation Studios walks through how they use cloud technologies to maximize render capacity. Learn how to leverage high-performance storage (like Amazon EFS), Amazon EC2 networking and the latest EC2 Spot features to provide a fully functional renderfarm at production-quality scale. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Media delivery requirements are continually changing, driven by accelerating mobile, tablet, smart TV, and set-top technology advances. Media services need to deliver higher-resolution content at lower bitrates to consumers, which has traditionally been a compute-intensive undertaking with slow advancements in the adoption of video codecs, containers, and related technologies.

In this session, we look at some of the existing workflow constraints, and explore a solution to process media in an agile fashion using modern, efficient codecs. We use Amazon S3 events and AWS Lambda to  configure media both pre- and post-process, process content in parallel with Amazon ECS using custom containers for a high level of elastic compute density, and deliver generated media to reference protocol clients via Amazon CloudFront. We also leverage Amazon EFS for scalable, shared storage in the distributed containerized environment for video processing. Issues include: parallel processing of content using Amazon ECS, pipelining and conversion of data using AWS Lambda, building an Amazon ECS-based media transcoding cluster, and delivering next-gen media through Amazon CloudFront. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

Our interactive educational experience relies upon an automated grading platform for programming assignments. But, because anyone can sign up for a course on Coursera for free, our systems must defend against arbitrary code execution.
&nbsp;
Come learn how Coursera uses AWS services such as Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS), and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to power a defense-in-depth strategy to secure our infrastructure against bad actors. We have modified the Amazon ECS Agent to support security layers including kernel privilege de-escalation, and enabling mandatory access control systems. Additionally, we post-process uploaded grading container images to defang binaries.

At the core of automated grading is a general-purpose near-line &amp; batch scheduling and execution microservice built on top of the Amazon ECS APIs. We use this flexible system to power a variety of internal services across the company including data exports for instructors, course announcement emails, data reconciliation jobs, and more.&nbsp;

					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Zombies have taken over major metropolitan areas. The AWS Lambda Signal Corps has built a communications system to connect remaining survivors. Come learn how AWS Lambda provides a platform for building event-driven microservices, all without the need to provision, manage, and scale servers. In this workshop, we will introduce the basics of using AWS Lambda to run code in response to events from Amazon DynamoDB, S3, and API Gateway. You'll work within a team to build a secure, scalable, fault-tolerant chat service with global reach from scratch using blueprints provided by us. Unfortunately, the blueprints provided only describe a very rudimentary communications system (the engineers of the project got mysteriously ill). We are looking to you and your team to add additional real-time life saving features (e.g., food cache locations, zombie motion detectors, undead counters) to the chat platform using Lambda functions.&nbsp; We will have a few special challenges for teams to complete. Rewards will be given to teams that complete all the extra-credit challenges.

Prerequisites:


	This survival workshop is open to all developers with a basic familiarity of the AWS APIs and a general revulsion towards the undead.
	Participants should have an AWS account established and available for use during the workshop.
	Please bring your own laptop.


Capacity: To encourage the interactive nature of this workshop, the session capacity is limited to approximately 70 attendees.&nbsp; Attendance is based on a first come, first served basis once onsite.&nbsp; Scheduling tools in the session catalog are for planning purposes only. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>
