			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Zynga, a leading developer of social games with popular titles such as FarmVille, Zynga Poker, Words With Friends, and Hit It Rich! Slots, was an early AWS customer that decided to move most of its infrastructure off AWS in 2011 to build its own private cloud and data centers. With changes to its business over the years—particularly a transition to mobile games—and an ever-increasing focus on analytics, Zynga determined that it would stop running its own infrastructure and migrate all of its workloads back to AWS by the end of 2015, gaining agility, infrastructure efficiency, and a reduction in their overall operating cost. In this session, learn from Dorion Carroll, chief information officer (CIO) for Zynga, as he discusses the specific reasons why Zynga decided to move back to AWS as well as his approach to Zynga's migration plan. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Successful companies, while focusing on their current customers' needs, often fail to embrace disruptive technologies and business models. This phenomenon, known as the "Innovator's Dilemma," eventually leads to many companies' downfall and is especially relevant in the fast-paced world of online services. In order to protect its leading position and grow its share of the highly competitive global digital streaming market, Netflix has to continuously increase the pace of innovation by constantly refining recommendation algorithms and adding new product features, while maintaining a high level of service uptime. The Netflix streaming platform consists of hundreds of microservices that are constantly evolving, and even the smallest production change may cause a cascading failure that can bring the entire service down. We face a new kind of Innovator's Dilemma, where product changes may not only disrupt the business model but also cause production outages that deny customers service access. This talk will describe various architectural, operational and organizational changes adopted by Netflix in order to reconcile rapid innovation with service availability. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">An 80-year old startup, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory continues to be a driving source of innovation in American technology. The past decade of this trek included NASA's expedition into cloud computing, seeing the delivery of cloud building blocks, initial applications, and a boom of higher order opportunities. These successes have begun to feed forward into enterprises and growing startups, while NASA continues to blaze a trail ahead. This talk by three of NASA's cloud explorers discusses what made this journey possible, how it was executed, and what lies ahead. In this session, Tom Soderstrom, chief technology and innovation officer for IT at NASA JPL, talks about how NASA thinks about innovation, the role of cloud computing in the innovation cycle, and how NASA took cloud computing from prototyping to playing a mission-critical role across the organization. You also hear from two influential JPL alumni who spread—and amplified—the approach. Come and hear the impact that cloud computing is having on science, discovery, and innovation, how missions at NASA are using cloud computing today, and where it is going in the future. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>
