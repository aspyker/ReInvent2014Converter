			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">In addition to running databases in Amazon EC2, AWS customers can choose among a variety of managed database services. These services save effort, save time, and unlock new capabilities and economies. In this session, we make it easy to understand how they differ, what they have in common, and how to choose one or more. We explain the fundamentals of Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service; Amazon RDS, a relational database service in the cloud; Amazon ElastiCache, a fast, in-memory caching service in the cloud; and Amazon Redshift, a fully managed, petabyte-scale data-warehouse solution that can be surprisingly economical. We will cover how each service might help support your application, how much each service costs, and how to get started. We will also have with us Jeongsang Baek, the VP of Engineering from IGAWorks, Korea’s No.1 mobile business platform, who will walk us through their architecture and share with us the key insights that they gained from using the various AWS database technologies to deliver a reliable, efficient and cost-effective experience. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>
