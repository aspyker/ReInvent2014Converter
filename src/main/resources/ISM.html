					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">In a time when mobile digital media engagement is at 51% (compared to desktop engagement at 42%), restaurants are turning to innovative and interactive technologies to attract customers. Consistent with its motto, “good food, fast”, McDonald’s turned to the cloud to reach always-on digital customers, enhance flexibility, and cut costs.

For the past year, Datapipe has been working with McDonald’s to develop the company’s first born-in-the-cloud mobile application. Datapipe’s AWS solution gives McDonald’s the flexibility to quickly spin up instances as demand increases. It creates a standardized, repeatable process for deployment to markets around the globe. This flexibility – both geographically and in the infrastructure – gives McDonald’s a hyperscalable environment (with the added benefit of cost containment) to take the restaurant into the modern age of consumer engagement.

In this session, representatives from McDonald’s and Datapipe will discuss the ongoing process of moving an iconic global enterprise into the 21st century. It looks in detail at the factors the company considered before moving to AWS, security concerns that needed to be addressed, and the long-term competitive advantage of using the AWS environment.&nbsp; Session sponsored by Datapipe. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">The AWS platform enables large enterprises to use data to solve business problems and uncover opportunities more easily and affordably than ever before. However, to truly take advantage of AWS, enterprises need a way to collect, store, process, analyze, and continually execute on their data.

Datapipe has been an AWS partner for more than five years. In that time, it has developed a proprietary process for the deployment of AWS environments, as well as the processing and evaluation of big data analytics to optimize these environments over time. This flexible solution includes automation tools, continuous monitoring, and cloud analytics. It protects against architectural sprawl and continually redesigns for scalability. This kind of continuous build environment allows Datapipe to examine the AWS environment as a complete picture and ensure the cloud environment is running as efficiently and effectively as possible, ultimately reducing overhead costs for the enterprise.

In this session, Jason Woodlee, Senior Director of Cloud Products at Datapipe, will discuss the technical details of designing and deploying a modern big data architecture on AWS, including application purpose and design, development environment and language overview, DevOps automation best practices, and continuous build and test frameworks.&nbsp; Session sponsored by Datapipe. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Delaware North is a major presence in the food and hospitality industry, serving more than 500 million&nbsp;customers at 200 venues around the world each year. The company decided to move almost all of its data&nbsp;center operations to AWS. The migration helped Delaware North reduce its server footprint by 91 percent,&nbsp;achieve a projected cost savings of $3.5 million over five years, improve PCI compliance and disaster&nbsp;recovery, and vastly streamline the delivery of new services and solutions internally and to its business&nbsp;customers. This session is for executives and enterprise architects who want to learn how a large enterprise&nbsp;organization adapted their teams, tooling, and methodology to successfully migrate their business-critical functions to the cloud. You will learn about the tried and tested methodology we used including: the four main stages of the&nbsp;migration factory; tooling for discovery, team collaboration, build and migration; how we worked&nbsp;alongside the Delaware North security team and their external QSAs to agree on the approach for adhering&nbsp;to compliance and regulations; how we developed scripts to automate as much of the workload as possible including the auditing of dangerous security groups; and the team and skill sets we needed for the&nbsp;migration to be successful.

				<span class="title">The Three Degrees of Freedom in the Cloud Drives the Need for Application-Defined Management</span>
			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">The typical Forbes Global 2000 enterprise has more than 5,000 applications. Amazon EC2 has more than 54,800 possible instance configurations for a simple three-tiered application. Managing the application lifecycle is challenging due to three interrelated degrees of freedom in the cloud: application proliferation, execution venue diversification, and the increase in the rate of change to one or both of the latter.

Creating rigid, hard-wired relationships between applications and infrastructure simply won’t scale. What’s needed is the ability to abstract up to the application level, define each application’s topology and dependencies, and use this metadata to allow the infrastructure environment to dynamically provision resources based on application criteria. This focus on the application and not just infrastructure is what’s behind application-defined cloud management.

			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Are you currently designing or implementing business solutions on AWS?
	Are you eager to discuss, and have an opportunity to present, your experience creating business solutions with other AWS customers?
	Would you like to participate in a collaborative workshop facilitated by the AWS Solutions Builder team?


If so, come participate with other AWS customers as we focus on the overall experience of using AWS to solve business problems.&nbsp; This is a great opportunity to collaborate with existing and prospective AWS users to validate your thinking and direction with AWS peers, discuss the resources that aid AWS solution design, and give direct feedback on your experience building solutions on AWS.

&nbsp;

The session will primarily consist of a collaborative, participant-driven activity, facilitated by the AWS Solutions Builder team, where we will encourage you to share your solutions-related knowledge and visions. As each team works through the exercise, you will discuss ideas, advice, or challenges when building on AWS, and identify the supporting resources and collateral you used or would like to see available.&nbsp; Each team will then have the opportunity to summarize and present their ideas to the group: what you built, why it is cool, what you learned, and the challenges you faced.

Prerequisites: We encourage you to come prepared to share specific business problems that you have solved or would like to solve, questions or advice for building solutions, or any pain points you encountered during the process.

Capacity: To encourage the interactive nature of this workshop, the session capacity is limited to approximately 70 attendees.&nbsp; Attendance is based on a first come, first served basis once onsite.&nbsp; Scheduling tools in the session catalog are for planning purposes only. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>
