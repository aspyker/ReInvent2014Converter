And I'm the guy with the pager. This is an in-the-trenches look at what operating at Netflix scale in the cloud is really like. It covers how Netflix views the velocity of innovation, expected failures, high availability, engineer responsibility, and obsessing over the quality of the customer experience.

					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Are you a CISO in cloud or security operations and architecture? The decisions you make when migrating and securing workloads at scale in the AWS cloud have a large impact on your business. This session will help you jump-start your migration to AWS or, if you’re already running workloads in AWS, teach you how your organization can secure and improve the efficiency of those deployments.

Infor’s Chief Information Security Officer will share what the organization learned tackling these issues at scale. You’ll hear how managing a traditional large-scale infrastructure can be simplified in AWS. You’ll understand why designing around the workload can simplify the structure of your teams and help them focus. Finally, you’ll see what these changes mean to your CxOs and how better visibility and understanding of your workloads will drive business success.&nbsp; Session sponsored by Trend Micro. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">When serious vulnerabilities like Shellshock or Heartbleed are discovered, you know you should respond quickly. But when you’re juggling many priorities and are more comfortable developing apps than security policies, emergency updates may fall to the bottom of the list. Is there a better way to protect your workloads without a lot of work?

In AWS, your entire deployment and infrastructure is code. Your security controls have to take the same approach. When your entire stack is code, you can automate protection for zero-day vulnerabilities, without impacting your architecture or adding operational burden.

In this session, you’ll learn how to respond and recover from the next zero-day vulnerability. Using real-world examples, you’ll see how you can combine AWS features, such as security groups, VPCs, and IAM roles with workload-aware security controls like intrusion prevention to automate your defenses.

Learn simple and easy-to-deploy security techniques that protect your workloads, but don’t require a PhD in cybersecurity.&nbsp; Session sponsored by Trend Micro. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

Keeping consistent environments across your development, test, and production systems can be a complex task. Enter containers!

Developers can use tools such as Docker Compose for local testing of complex applications; Jenkins and AWS CodePipeline for building and orchestration; and Amazon ECS to manage and scale their containers. Come to this session to learn how to build containers into your continuous deployment workflow, accelerating the testing and building phases and leading to more frequent software releases. Attendees will learn to use Docker containers to develop their applications and test locally with Docker Compose (or Amazon ECS local), integrate containers in building, deploy complex applications on Amazon ECS, and orchestrate continuous development workflows with CodePipeline. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">In this session, we will learn how to define and run multi-container applications with Docker Compose. Then, we will show how to deploy and scale them seamlessly to a cluster with Docker Swarm; and how&nbsp;Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) eliminates the need to install,operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure. We will also walk through some best practice patterns used by customers for running their microservices platforms or batch jobs. Sample code and Compose templates will be provided on GitHub afterwards. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

				<span class="title">Deep Dive into Blue/Green Deployments on AWS</span>
			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Learn how the Blue/Green Deployment methodology combined with AWS tools and services can help reduce the risks associated with software deployment. We will illustrate common patterns and highlight ways deployment risks are mitigated by each pattern. Topics will include how services like AWS CloudFormation, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon EC2 Container Service, Amazon Route53, Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing can help automate deployment. We will also address how to effectively manage deployments in the context of data model and schema changes. Learn how you can adopt blue/green for your software release processes in a cost-effective and low-risk way. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>
