			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Digital platforms are by nature resource intensive, expensive to build, and difficult to manage at scale. What if we can change this perception and help AWS customers architect a digital platform that is low cost and low maintenance? This session describes the underlying architecture behind dam.deep.mg, the Digital Asset Management system built by Mitoc Group and powered by AWS abstracted services like AWS Lambda, Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon DynamoDB. Eugene Istrati, the CTO of Mitoc Group, will dive deep into their approach to microservices architecture on serverless environments and demonstrate how anyone can architect AWS abstracted services to achieve high scalability, high availability, and high performance without huge efforts or expensive resources allocation. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

Our current use case of Seagull involves distributively running Yelp's test suite that has over 55,000 test cases. Using our smart scheduling, we can run one of our largest test suites to process 42 hours of serial work in less than 10 minutes using 200 r3.8xlarge instances from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). Seagull consumes and produces data at very high rates. On a typical day, Seagull writes 60 GBs of data and consumes 20 TBs of data. Although we are currently using Seagull to parallelize test execution, it can efficiently parallelize other types of independent tasks. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

				<span class="title">Cloud First: New Architecture for New Infrastructure</span>
			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">What do companies with internal platforms have to change to succeed in the cloud? The five pillars at the heart of IT solutions in the cloud are automation, fault tolerance, horizontal scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness. This talk discusses tools that facilitate the development and automate the deployment of secure, highly available microservices. The tools were developed using AWS CloudFormation, AWS SDKs, AWS CLI, Amazon RDS, and various open-source software such as Docker. The talk provides concrete examples of how these tools can help developers and architects move from beginning/intermediate AWS practitioners to cloud deployment experts. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

				<span class="title">Double Redundancy with AWS Direct Connect</span>
			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">AWS Direct Connect provides low latency and high performance connectivity to the AWS cloud by allowing the provision of physical fiber from the customer’s location or data center into AWS Direct Connect points of presence. This session covers design considerations around AWS Direct Connect solutions. We will discuss how to design and configure physical and logical redundancy using both physically redundant fibers and logical VPN connectivity, and includes a live demo showing both the configuration and the failure of a doubly redundant connectivity solution. This session is for network engineers/architects, technical professionals, and infrastructure managers who have a working knowledge of Amazon VPC, Amazon EC2, general networking, and routing protocols. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

				<span class="title">From One to Many: Evolving VPC Design</span>
			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">As more customers adopt Amazon VPC architectures, the features and flexibility of the service are squaring off against evolving design requirements. This session follows this evolution of a single regional VPC into a multi-VPC, multiregion design with diverse connectivity into on-premises systems and infrastructure. Along the way, we investigate creative customer solutions for scaling and securing outbound VPC traffic, securing private access to S3, managing multitenant VPCs, integrating existing customer networks through AWS Direct Connect and building a full VPC mesh network across global regions. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>
