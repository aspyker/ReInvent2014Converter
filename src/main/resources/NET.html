				<span class="title">Creating Your Virtual Data Center: VPC Fundamentals and Connectivity Options</span>
			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">In this session, we will walk through the fundamentals of Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). First, we will cover build-out and design fundamentals for VPC, including picking your IP space, subnetting, routing, security, NAT, and much more. We will then transition into different approaches and use cases for optionally connecting your VPC to your physical data center with VPN or AWS Direct Connect.&nbsp; This mid-level architecture discussion is aimed at architects, network administrators, and technology decision-makers interested in understanding the building blocks AWS makes available with VPC and how you can connect this with your offices and current data center footprint. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Delivering a managed database-as-a-service in a highly secure and simple way can be a challenging problem, especially when your customers have many different network and access requirements. We went through many iterations trying to find a model that was easy to support, but also gave our customers control and visibility. In this session, we explore the incredibly flexible AWS networking solutions that we have used to deliver our services to customers with wildly different architectures. This is an advanced session for those who want deliver services into complex or divergent network architectures, while still maintaining control of the infrastructure that your services are deployed on. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">In this session, explore three benefits of private, dedicated network connections to AWS. Learn how you can transport business-critical data directly from your data center, office, or colocation environment into and from AWS over dedicated network connections. Discover how to dynamically scale your bandwidth up to 300 percent, only paying for what you use, and how to use dynamic scaling to speed up backups, temporary or scheduled workloads, moving from test to live production, and new product launches. Also, learn how to use private network connectivity to help build hybrid environments in situations where security and compliance are critical. Hybrid environments let you extend your private on-premises infrastructure with the elasticity and economic benefits of AWS.&nbsp; Session sponsored by Level 3. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">What if weather or any other major event prevents a large number of your users from coming into the office? Does your VPN or remote connectivity solution scale? &nbsp;

Deploying solutions in AWS gives you access to agility, cost savings, elasticity, breadth of functionality, and the ability to deploy globally in minutes. With access to these benefits through the AWS platform, administrators can launch global, scalable and resilient VPN solutions to support your business at a moments notice.

In this session, learn how to build a flexible, elastic, highly secure VPN infrastructure by using Amazon Route 53, Amazon EC2, Auto Scaling, and 3rd party solutions to allow hundreds or thousands of users to work remotely as soon as the first snowflakes begin to fall.&nbsp;

To attend this session it is suggested that attendees have a working knowledge of VPC, EC2, general networking and an understanding of routing protocols. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) has many obvious benefits. For example, you can use Amazon VPC to define a virtual network in your own logically isolated area within the AWS cloud, and launch your EC2 instances into a VPC. But how can you take advantage of the EC2-VPC platform if your services and infrastructure are already deployed in the EC2-Classic platform? In this deep-dive session, learn how to safely and reliably migrate from EC2-Classic to EC2-VPC with zero downtime. We show you how Twilio approached the problem of a VPC migration, or what we internally called the “Moving Datacenters Project.” We discuss the technologies and tools (both internal and external) we used to complete the migration, the infrastructure we built along the way, and the lessons we learned.&nbsp;
