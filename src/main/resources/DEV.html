			<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">The AWS SDK for Go is now live and ready for developers to build productive applications with using the Go programming language. This session will show you how to get started using the AWS SDK for Go. We’ll introduce the best practices for how to use the SDK, and how it integrates with your Go application. We will explore an example application which uses async programming with Amazon S3 and Amazon SQS to distribute tasks across multiple concurrent goroutines, and use Amazon Elastic Beanstalk to deploy and scale the application. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="lessLink">View Less</a></span>

				<span class="title">CI/CD of Services with Mocking and Resiliency Testing Using AWS</span>
			</a>


					<span class="abstract truncatedTxt">At Intuit, we are migrating many services to AWS. We have developed a tool called Slingshot to automate our entire onboarding process. It sets up our AWS account; generates the Jenkins flow pipeline; and then automatically builds, tests, deploys, and promotes our applications/services in the software development pipeline. The deployment automation provides zero downtime with fast cutover and quick rollbacks.

Additionally, one of the challenges of implementing CI/CD with service-oriented architectures (SOA) is reliable execution of test automation. Because every service evolves on its own schedule, having a single integrated test environment is virtually impossible. One way to handle this complexity is dependency mocking. We use the Wiremock tool, which allows users to stub for service dependencies and do resiliency testing that was hard to automate before.
